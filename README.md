# A beginner's guide to debloating your Galaxy S10 *safely* using ADB commands
This repository is meant for beginners and contains the steps and scripts necessary to remove bloat apps from your Galaxy S10.
The goal of this repository is to be beginner-friendly, by providing a list of apps that are **safe** to remove from your device, and telling you what each app does. Many other guides  don't tell you any of this information, leaving you to research it yourself, or, even worse-- just removing the app without knowing what it does.  
If you have experience with ADB and know what you're doing, you can skip right to the [Usage](#usage). Otherwise, I reccomend that you read the entirety of this guide, to avoid bricking your phone or doing the process incorrectly.

# Prerequisites:
