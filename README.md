# A beginner's guide to debloating your Galaxy S10 *safely* using ADB commands
This repository is meant for beginners and contains the steps and scripts necessary to remove bloat apps from your Galaxy S10.
The goal of this repository is to be beginner-friendly, by providing a list of apps that are **safe** to remove from your device, and telling you what each app does. Many other guides  don't tell you any of this information, leaving you to research it yourself, or, even worse-- just removing the app without knowing what it does.  
If you have experience with ADB and know what you're doing, you can skip right to the [Usage](#usage). Otherwise, I reccomend that you read the entirety of this guide, to avoid bricking your phone or doing the process incorrectly.

# Prerequisites:
- ADB installed on your computer
- Developer Options enabled on your S10
- USB debugging enabled on your S10

## Installing ADB
1. [Download](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) the Android SDK Platform Tools ZIP file for Windows 
   - Note: the download is a .zip file, ~12MB compressed, ~35MB uncompressed
2. Extract the contents of the .zip file to an easily accessible directory (I used C:\, but feel free to use any directory)
3. Open the "platform-tools" folder that should've been automatically created when you unzipped the .zip file 
   - Note: if you created a folder with a different name and extracted the contents of the .zip file to it, you should open that folder
4. While holding Shift, right-click anywhere in the folder (but not selecting a file)
5. Press "Open CMD/PowerShell window here"
6. Test that you have ADB installed properly by using the command adb --version (you might need to use a .\ infront of the command to let it run in PowerShell)
