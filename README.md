# Debloat your Galaxy S10 *safely* using ADB commands
This repository contains the steps and scripts necessary to remove bloat apps from your Galaxy S10.
The goal of this repository is provide a list of apps that are safe to remove from your device, and tell you what each app does- many other guides online don't tell you any of this information, leaving you to research it yourself, or, even worse-- just remove the app without knowing what it does.
